Applications of Soft computing

All these programs were performed on Jupyter Notebook
First program is about Creating a perceptron with appropriate no. of inputs and outputs. Train it using fixed increment learning algorithm until no change in weights is required. Output the final weights. 
Second Program is about Implementing Union, Intersection, Complement and Difference operations on fuzzy sets. Also create fuzzy relation by Cartesian product of any two fuzzy sets and perform maxmin composition on any two fuzzy relations. 
Third program is Implementation of TSP using GA.
